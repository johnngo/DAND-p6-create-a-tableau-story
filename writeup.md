## Summary
-----------
The Titanic dataset includes the demographics and passenger information from a subset of the 2224 passengers and crew on board the Titanic. I am looking to create a visualization to show the percentage of people who survived due to factors such as Age,Sex, higher passenger class, higher fare and did travelling with family increase your chance of survival.

### Design
----------
In the design stage, I'm looking to display how each of the factors (Age Group, Gender, Ticket Class(1st,2nd,3rd) and Ticket fare(high and low price) affect survival rate of the passenger/s.

I think bar charts will show how each of the factors affect survival rates. Since we only have two variables(survival rate, factor), it is easy to compare survival rates.

I chose to put average survival rate on the X-axis and each factor(Gender, Ticket Class, Age Group, and ticket fare in Y-axis so it is easy to compare average survival rate by looking at the height of the bar chart.
