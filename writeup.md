Final Public tableau


## Summary
-----------
The Titanic dataset includes the demographics and passenger information from a subset of the 2224 passengers and crew on board the Titanic. I am looking to create a visualization to show the percentage of people who survived due to factors such as Age, Sex, higher passenger class, higher fare and did travelling with family increase your chance of survival.

### Design
----------
In the design stage,I'm looking to display how each of the factors(Age Group, Gender, Ticket Class(1st,2nd,3rd), Ticket fare(high and low price), number of family members(brothers,sister, mother, father..etc)) affect survival rate of the passenger/s.

I think bar charts will show how each of the factors affect survival rates. Since we only have two variables(survival rate, factor), it is easy to compare survival rates.

I chose to put average survival rate on the X-axis and each factor(Gender, Ticket Class, Age Group, Ticket fare, number of family members) in Y-axis so it is easy to compare average survival rate by looking at the height of the bar chart.
