## Summary
-----------
The Titanic dataset includes the demographics and passenger information from a subset of the 2224 passengers and crew on board the Titanic. I am looking to create a visualization to show the percentage of people who survived due to factors such as Age,Sex, Passenger Class, and Higher fare increase your chance of survival.

### Design
----------
In the design stage, I'm looking to display how each of the factors (Age Group, Gender, Ticket Class(1st,2nd,3rd) and Ticket fare(high and low price) affect survival rate of the passenger/s.

I think bar charts will show how each of the factors affect survival rates. Since we only have two variables(survival rate, factor), it is easy to compare survival rates.

I chose to put average survival rate on the X-axis and each factor(Gender, Ticket Class, Age Group,and ticket fare in Y-axis so it is easy to compare average survival rate by looking at the height of the bar chart.

### Feedback

Initial Version
---------------
What do you notice in the visualization?

I think the story board looks promising, I think as a reader it's hard to understand without some text to explain the bar graphs.

What questions do you have about the data?

I think the bar chart is great, it would be nice to see a little bit more explanation
about the relationship.

What relationships do you notice?

It's hard to tell the relationship at this time.

What do you think is the main takeaway from this visualization?

It looks like you're attempting to explain the relationship between the different factors and survivorship.

Is there something you don’t understand in the graphic?

I think it will be helpful to have some text to accompany the story board, it looks promising. Keep up the good work!

Second Version
--------------
What do you notice in the visualization?

I see a big improvement over your first version. The relationship between survivorship and the factors are much clearer.

What questions do you have about the data?
Some of data is unclear for example, passenger clase

What relationships do you notice?
The relationship earlier in the story board was clear. As the story board progress,
it was challenging to see the relationship.

What do you think is the main takeaway from this visualization?
To gain insight into the relationship between survivorship and a list of factors.

Is there something you don’t understand in the graphic?

I think the overall message you're trying to convey is better, however, with 
consistent formatting, I think it will enhance your overall project.
